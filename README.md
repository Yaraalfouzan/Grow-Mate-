# Grow-Mate-
  As part of our Human-Computer Interaction course project, we designed the UX/UI following design principles for "Grow Mate,"  an IoT-based automated plant care system. Our app enables users to monitor plant health, control watering remotely, and receive real-time care updates. The app allows users to search for plants, add them to home screen if they own them where they can check the health of their plants and users can also add plants to favorites list.
  
  Before the design, we conducted a comprehensive system analysis. And throughout the design process, we did evaluation experiments to identify and address areas for improvement, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient experience.
